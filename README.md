Here is the Artoolkit package forour Jevois Camera:jevois.org 

You can use it to build your own Augmented Reality applications and do marker detection in Jevois Smart Camera

It works really well and nice and you can follow the tutorial on http://jevois.org/doc/ProgrammerSDK.html to install it your own Jevois Camera. 

The code is the easiest version for you to understand how to write a module for Artoolkit. Although it is not the fastest way to run it on the Jevois Camera. The cleaned but a little hard to understand version can be found in https://github.com/jevois and you can find the new Artoolkit module under the jevois base folder. 

The Artoolkit version is artoolkit 5.32 which you can get at https://archive.artoolkit.org/download-artoolkit-sdk or you can just download this package that contained the artoolkit 5.32 in Contrib folder .

Some Jevois command which is really useful is put into: jevois library command line

The artoolkit library is putted in the Contrib folder and our code is in the source folder. Also, The MakeList in the main folder is a good way to understand how to write a makefile in order to compile and link the openCV library.

If you have any problem, pls send emails to shixianw@usc.edu

The Markers can be found in the doc folder in the Contrib folder.
